# Interactables Manual

## Overview

All interactable objects in the Shababeek Interaction System inherit from `InteractableBase`. This base class provides the core interaction functionality that allows objects to respond to hand interactions, raycasting, and other input methods.

## Common Requirements

All interactables require these components to function properly:

- **Collider** - For physical interaction detection
- **InteractableBase** (or derived class) - Core interaction logic
- **Rigidbody** - For physics-based interactions (optional for some types)
- **Pose Constrainter** (automatic on constrained interactables) - For hand pose/positioning

## Common Inspector Properties

All interactables share these base properties in the Inspector:

### **Interaction Hand** (InteractionHand)
- **What it does**: Specifies which hands can interact with this object (Left, Right, or Both)
- **Default**: Both 
- **When to use**: Set to limit interaction to specific hands
- **Example**: Set to Left only for left-handed tools

### **Selection Button** (XRButton)
- **What it does**: The button that triggers selection of this interactable (Grip or Trigger)
- **Default**: Grip
- **When to use**: Choose based on the object's interaction style
- **Example**: Use Trigger for precise interactions, Grip for grab interactions

### **On Selected** (InteractorUnityEvent)
- **What it does**: Event raised when this interactable is selected by an interactor
- **Default**: Empty
- **Common uses**: Play selection sounds, change materials, show UI hints

### **On Deselected** (InteractorUnityEvent)
- **What it does**: Event raised when this interactable is deselected by an interactor
- **Default**: Empty
- **Common uses**: Restore original materials, hide UI hints, stop effects

### **On Hover Start** (InteractorUnityEvent)

- **Current Interactor** (InteractorBase) - The interactor currently interacting with this object
- **Current State** (InteractionState) - The current interaction state

## Interactable Types

### **Grabable**

**Menu Location**: `Component > Shababeek > Interactables > Grabable`
**What it does**: Allows objects to be picked up and held by hands. The object follows the hand's movement and rotation.
**How it works**: When selected, the object becomes a child of the hand and follows its transform. When deselected, it can either return to its original position or be thrown if the Throwable Component is added.
**Inspector Properties**:

- **Hide Hand** (bool)[deprecated use UnifedPsoeConstraints insteead]
  - **What it does**: Whether to hide the hand model when this object is grabbed
  - **Default**: false
  - **When to use**: Enable for objects that should hide the hand during interaction

## Event Subscription Examples

```csharp
// Lever
var lever = GetComponent<LeverInteractable>();
lever.OnLeverChanged.Subscribe(value => Debug.Log($"Lever: {value}"));

// Subscribe to selection events
interactable.OnSelected.Subscribe(interactor => {
    Debug.Log($"Object selected by {interactor.name}!");
});

// Subscribe to deselection events
interactable.OnDeselected.Subscribe(interactor => {
    Debug.Log($"Object deselected by {interactor.name}!");
});

// Subscribe to hover events
interactable.OnHoverStarted.Subscribe(interactor => {
    Debug.Log($"Object hovered by {interactor.name}!");
});

interactable.OnHoverEnded.Subscribe(interactor => {
    Debug.Log($"Object hover ended by {interactor.name}!");
});

// Subscribe to activation events
interactable.OnActivated.Subscribe(interactor => {
    Debug.Log($"Object activated by {interactor.name}!");
});
```

### **Subscribing to Specific Interactable Events**

```csharp
// For LeverInteractable
LeverInteractable lever = GetComponent<LeverInteractable>();
lever.OnLeverChanged.Subscribe(value => {
    Debug.Log($"Lever value: {value}"); // value is between 0 and 1
});

// For DrawerInteractable
DrawerInteractable drawer = GetComponent<DrawerInteractable>();
drawer.OnValueChanged.Subscribe(value => {
    Debug.Log($"Drawer value: {value}"); // value is between 0 and 1
});

// For Throwable
Throwable throwable = GetComponent<Throwable>();
throwable.OnThrowEnd.Subscribe(velocity => {
    Debug.Log($"Object thrown with velocity: {velocity}");
});
```

### **Using UniRx Observables**

```csharp
// Get the interactable
InteractableBase interactable = GetComponent<InteractableBase>();

// Subscribe to UniRx observables
IDisposable selectedSubscription = interactable.OnSelected.Subscribe(interactor => {
    Debug.Log($"Object selected by {interactor.name} via UniRx!");
});

IDisposable deselectedSubscription = interactable.OnDeselected.Subscribe(interactor => {
    Debug.Log($"Object deselected by {interactor.name} via UniRx!");
});

// Dispose subscriptions when done (important to prevent memory leaks)
selectedSubscription.Dispose();
deselectedSubscription.Dispose();

// Or use AddTo(this) for automatic disposal when the component is destroyed
interactable.OnSelected
    .Subscribe(interactor => Debug.Log("Selected!"))
    .AddTo(this);
```

## Creating Custom Interactables

### **Basic Custom Interactable**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Shababeek.Interactions;

public class CustomInteractable : InteractableBase
{
    [SerializeField] private string customMessage = "Custom interaction!";
    
    protected override void Activate()
    {
        // Called when the alternative button is pressed while selected
        Debug.Log($"Activated: {customMessage}");
    }
    
    protected override void StartHover()
    {
        // Called when an interactor starts hovering
        Debug.Log("Started hovering");
    }
    
    protected override void EndHover()
    {
        // Called when an interactor stops hovering
        Debug.Log("Ended hovering");
    }
    
    protected override bool Select()
    {
        // Called when an interactor selects this object
        // Return true to prevent default selection behavior
        Debug.Log($"Selected: {customMessage}");
        return false; // Allow default selection
    }
    
    protected override void DeSelected()
    {
        // Called when an interactor deselects this object
        Debug.Log("Deselected");
    }
}
```

### **Custom Constrained Interactable**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Shababeek.Interactions;

public class CustomConstrainedInteractable : ConstrainedInteractableBase
{
    [SerializeField] private float rotationSpeed = 90f; // degrees per second
    
    protected override void Activate()
    {
        // Custom activation logic
    }
    
    protected override void StartHover()
    {
        // Custom hover start logic
    }
    
    protected override void EndHover()
    {
        // Custom hover end logic
    }
    
    protected override void HandleObjectMovement()
    {
        if (!IsSelected) return;
        
        // Custom movement logic
        Vector3 direction = CurrentInteractor.transform.position - transform.position;
        float angle = Vector3.SignedAngle(transform.forward, direction, transform.up);
        
        // Apply rotation
        interactableObject.Rotate(0, angle * rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime, 0);
    }
    
    protected override void HandleObjectDeselection()
    {
        // Custom deselection logic
        // Reset position, play sound, etc.
    }
}
```

### **Custom Interactable with Events**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;
using Shababeek.Interactions;

public class CustomEventInteractable : InteractableBase
{
    [Header("Custom Events")]
    [SerializeField] private UnityEvent onCustomAction;
    [SerializeField] private UnityEvent<float> onValueChanged;
    
    [Header("Settings")]
    [SerializeField] private float interactionValue = 0f;
    
    protected override void Activate()
    {
        // Trigger custom action
        onCustomAction?.Invoke();
        
        // Update value and trigger event
        interactionValue = Mathf.Clamp01(interactionValue + 0.1f);
        onValueChanged?.Invoke(interactionValue);
    }
    
    protected override bool Select()
    {
        Debug.Log("Custom interactable selected!");
        return false;
    }
    
    protected override void DeSelected()
    {
        Debug.Log("Custom interactable deselected!");
    }
    
    // Public method to reset the interaction value
    public void ResetValue()
    {
        interactionValue = 0f;
        onValueChanged?.Invoke(interactionValue);
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Object not responding to interaction:**
- Check that the object has a Collider
- Verify the object is on the correct layer
- Ensure the InteractableBase component is attached
- Check that an Interactor is present in the scene

**Physics behaving unexpectedly:**
- Adjust Rigidbody mass and drag values
- Check collision detection settings
- Verify collider size and shape
- Test with different physics materials

**Events not triggering:**
- Verify UnityEvents are properly connected
- Check that the correct event is being used
- Test with simple debug logs first
- Ensure no errors in the console

### **Performance Tips**

- Use appropriate collider types (BoxCollider for simple shapes)
- Limit the number of active interactables in large scenes
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Optimize feedback systems for VR performance
